            Once upon a time, in a kingdom split cleanly between heroes and villains, there lived four teenagers on the Isle of the Lost—-Mal, Evie, Jay, and Carlos. They grew up as the children of the most notorious villains, tucked away in a place where magic had long faded, the sky always felt a little dull, and living meant being evil.
            <br><br>
            Everything changed when Prince Ben, the future king of Auradon, suggested that the children of the villains deserved a chance at a better life. His first royal decree brought Mal and her friends to the bright, perfect world of Auradon Prep.
            <br><br>
            Their parents gave them one mission:
            steal Fairy Godmother’s wand and set all villains free.

            At first, the four teens tried to blend in while secretly planning their mission. But Auradon felt different—happier and brighter. Evie realized she didn’t need magic or a mirror to prove she was smart. Jay found out he didn’t have to steal to be good at something, he actually fit in perfectly with the school’s sports teams. Carlos slowly let go of the fears his mother gave him and learned how to trust people for the first time. And Mal, who had spent her whole life trying to please her mother Maleficent, discovered she could make her own choices… and while doing that, she even started to fall in love.
            Prince Ben’s belief in her made her see she could choose her own future.
            <br><br>
            During Ben’s coronation, Mal had the perfect chance to take the wand—but she chose something new. She chose good. And when Maleficent arrived to force her back into villainy, Mal and her friends stood together and defeated her, proving that who you are isn’t defined by where you come from.
            <br><br>
            In the end, the four of them stayed in Auradon not as villains’ children, but as teens finally free to write their own stories.
