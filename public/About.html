                About Lia<br><br>

                Eiliyah Chryselle M. Beltran, also known as Lia, has been a fan of Descendants and their song “If Only” since 2018. She continues to regularly rewatch the movies and listen to their songs. Out of all the Descendants films, the first movie has always been her favorite, which is why it was chosen as the focus of this website. 
                
                <br><br>The purpose of the website is to make other fans happy and to encourage those who haven’t watched the movie yet to explore it and learn more about it through the site.<br><br>
